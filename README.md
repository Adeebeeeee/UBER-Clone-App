# Uber Clone App (MERN Stack)

## Overview

This project is a complete **Uber Clone** built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It features a fully functional ride-booking application, with a user-friendly interface, backend APIs, and real-time functionalities. The app mimics the core features of the Uber app, including booking rides, viewing drivers, and real-time tracking.

## Features

- **User Interface**: Designed with React.js for an intuitive front-end.
- **Backend APIs**: Developed with Node.js and Express for handling ride-booking, user management, and trip details.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Implemented using WebSockets for live location updates.
- **Authentication**: User login and registration via JWT-based authentication.
